Title: Moody in the City: Your unofficial guide to Lexington, Fayette County, and beyond

Welcome! Thanks for visiting! Here at Moody in the City, we are collaborating on a community hub meant to highlight what makes our city special. We'd like to be an online visitor's center that highlights those places either popular or not, on the beaten path or off, that you'd like to share. Not just with your friends, but with anyone that would like to discover the parts of our community with which they are not as familiar. That favorite shop, restaurant, band, artist, or event you think is awesome? Share it with us here! Just register, log in, click on create a post at the top, and start sharing!

User stories: As a new resident, I want to get to know my new town, so I can discover what there is to do. As a resident with a limited social media presence, I still want to participate in local events, so I need a place to go to stay informed. As a person who generally sticks to my neighborhood and work, Iâ€™d like to branch out and discover new places and events and know when and where they are. As a person on a budget, I still like to go out to interesting places and I want to have information about them before prioritizing and going to the effort or expense. As a resident, I want to discover more about the art/music scene in Lexington and need a push in the right direction.

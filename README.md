Bootcamp Final Project

Title: Moody in the City: Your unofficial guide to Lexington, Fayette County, and beyond

User stories: As a new resident, I want to get to know my new town, so I can discover what there is to do. As a resident with a limited social media presence, I still want to participate in local events, so I need a place to go to stay informed. As a person who generally sticks to my neighborhood and work, Iâ€™d like to branch out and discover new places and events and know when and where they are. As a person on a budget, I still like to go out to interesting places and I want to have information about them before prioritizing and going to the effort or expense. As a resident, I want to discover more about the art/music scene in Lexington and need a push in the right direction.

Tentative sections: The tour guides section and links to social media/youtube Local music (bands and venues) Local arts (murals, museums, galleries, events) Places to visit (parks, family outings, things to see) Stories? Calendar

Each section below/next to the tour guide should have opportunity for user input. -text, image, video?
